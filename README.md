# Computer-Internet-Connections-Project
As part of a team of course mates, we completed a comprehensive network design project using Cisco Packet Tracer. The objective was to simulate and configure a modern, well-connected workplace that meets the needs of a dynamic office environment. Our focus was on ensuring seamless connectivity, security, and reliable communication between all users and departments.

Project Goals:

Populate the workplace with multiple offices, each equipped with specific hardware to support departmental needs.
Establish seamless internet connectivity for all users, regardless of their location in the building.
Include a dedicated server room outfitted with essential servers and network machinery, ensuring robust backend infrastructure.
Deploy 100 wireless access points in the open-plan floor area to provide high-quality Wi-Fi coverage for large numbers of wireless clients.
Ensure full network interoperability so that all PCs and devices can effectively ping and send packets to each other, verifying end-to-end connectivity across the network.

Key Features and Implementation:
1. Office Hardware Setup
Each office was assigned tailored hardware such as desktops, VoIP phones, printers, and network switches.
Devices were logically grouped according to office requirements, supporting efficient workflow and departmental segregation.

2. Server Room Configuration
Configured a range of servers, including file servers, web servers, and authentication servers.
Server room was designed with high-capacity switches and redundant links, ensuring high availability and reliability.
A dedicated Wi-Fi access point was installed for restricted wireless management access within the server area.

3. Wireless Network Design
Placed and configured 100 wireless access points throughout the open-plan area to guarantee robust and uninterrupted Wi-Fi for all clients.
Selected optimal AP placement to minimize dead zones, interference, and bandwidth bottlenecks.
Implemented secure authentication protocols to protect wireless communications.

4. Seamless Connectivity
Designed the network with appropriate IP addressing and VLAN segmentation where necessary.
Configured routers and switches using dynamic routing protocols and spanning tree configurations to ensure redundancy and loop-free topology.
Conducted comprehensive connectivity tests, confirming that every PC could ping any other PC on the network and exchange packets successfully.

Testing and Verification:
Ran packet-tracing simulations to validate connectivity, speed, and reliability across both wired and wireless networks.
Simulated various failure scenarios (such as device or link failures) to test network resilience, observing how redundancy features responded to outages.
Verified all documentation, including network diagrams and configuration files, for reproducibility and peer review.

Documentation:
All project files, including network topology diagrams, device configurations, test reports, and detailed setup documentation, are organized and maintained in the project repository. This ensures transparency, repeatability, and facilitates further learning or expansion by future project teams.

Conclusion:
This project reinforced practical networking skills in planning, deploying, and testing complex enterprise network infrastructures. Working collaboratively allowed us to apply theoretical concepts in a real-world simulation, ensuring every device—from desk PCs to core servers—could reliably communicate within a secure, high-performance network environment.
